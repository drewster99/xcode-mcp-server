## Implementation Details

### Project Template Generation — Toolchain Awareness

**Current behavior (as of this writing)**: `create_project` does NOT use Xcode at
all to scaffold a project, and does NOT consult the `xcode-select`-selected
toolchain. The entire project is synthesized in-process from hardcoded Python
string constants in `drews_xcode_mcp/utils/project_templates.py`. There is no
`xcrun`, no `DEVELOPER_DIR`, no read of Xcode's `.xctemplate` bundles, and no
filesystem copy — the only filesystem call in that module is `open(path, 'x')`
(a write). `generate_project()` fills the templates with fresh UUIDs and writes
each file directly.

The eight baked-in template constants and what they produce:
| Constant | Produces |
|---|---|
| `PBXPROJ_TEMPLATE` | `project.pbxproj` |
| `WORKSPACE_DATA_TEMPLATE` | `project.xcworkspace/contents.xcworkspacedata` |
| `APP_SWIFT_TEMPLATE` | `{Identifier}App.swift` |
| `CONTENT_VIEW_TEMPLATE` | `ContentView.swift` |
| `ASSETS_CONTENTS_JSON` | `Assets.xcassets/Contents.json` |
| `ACCENT_COLOR_CONTENTS_JSON` | `AccentColor.colorset/Contents.json` |
| `APP_ICON_IOS_CONTENTS_JSON` / `APP_ICON_MACOS_CONTENTS_JSON` | `AppIcon.appiconset/Contents.json` |

Real Xcode templates (for reference) live at:
`<selected Xcode>.app/Contents/Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates/…`
(resolve the active Xcode with `xcode-select -p` / `xcrun --find`).

**Problem**: The generated format is FROZEN in source, independent of whatever
Xcode is selected:
- `objectVersion = 77` + `PBXFileSystemSynchronizedRootGroup` → requires Xcode 16+.
  On an older selected Xcode the project may fail to open or prompt to upgrade.
- Default deployment target hardcoded to `26.0`, default bundle id
  `com.example.{identifier}`.
- Only a SwiftUI App template (iOS/macOS). No other product types, no tests
  target, no Storyboard/UIKit, no Swift package, etc.
- As Xcode evolves the pbxproj format (object version bumps, new isa types),
  these strings silently drift out of date and must be hand-edited.

This is intentional decoupling (project creation works with zero dependency on
where/whether Xcode's templates exist), but it trades freshness and fidelity for
that independence.

**Goal**: Let `create_project` respect the selected toolchain (and/or broaden the
template set) without giving up the "works offline / no Xcode UI" property where
possible.

**Options (roughly increasing fidelity / effort)**:
1. **Version-adaptive hardcoded templates (smallest change)**. Detect the active
   Xcode version (`xcodebuild -version` / parse `version.plist` under
   `xcode-select -p`) and pick an `objectVersion` + group style that matches
   (e.g. emit a pre-77 file-group layout for Xcode < 16). Keep generation
   in-process. Pros: still no Xcode UI, no template parsing. Cons: we maintain N
   format variants by hand.
2. **Derive defaults from the toolchain**. Even if we keep our own pbxproj
   strings, pull the default deployment target and available SDKs from the
   selected Xcode (`xcrun --sdk iphoneos --show-sdk-version`, etc.) instead of
   hardcoding `26.0`. Low effort, removes the most surprising hardcode.
3. **Drive Xcode's real templates** via the toolchain. Investigate scaffolding
   from `…/Library/Xcode/Templates/…` (the same `.xctemplate` bundles Xcode's
   "New Project" uses) so output matches exactly what a user gets in the IDE.
   This is non-trivial: the template format (`TemplateInfo.plist`, ancestors,
   option substitution) is undocumented and Xcode applies it through internal
   machinery, not a public CLI. Highest fidelity, highest risk/maintenance.
4. **Expand product types** regardless of source: add a tests target, a macOS
   AppKit/SwiftUI choice, a Swift Package option, etc. — orthogonal to where the
   format comes from, but worth tracking here.

**Recommendation**: Start with options 1 + 2 (version-adaptive `objectVersion`
and toolchain-derived deployment target/SDK). They remove the real correctness
risk (a frozen format that breaks on older/newer Xcode) while preserving the
no-Xcode-needed generation path. Treat option 3 as research-only until there's a
demonstrated need for exact IDE parity.

**Validation when implemented**:
- Generate on machines with different `xcode-select` targets and confirm the
  project opens cleanly in each (no upgrade prompt, no "damaged project").
- Round-trip: open the generated project, let Xcode re-save, and diff the
  pbxproj to see what Xcode would have changed.
- Keep a regression test that opens each generated variant headlessly.

**Key files**: `drews_xcode_mcp/utils/project_templates.py` (the templates +
`generate_project`), `drews_xcode_mcp/tools/create_project.py` (validation +
entry point), `drews_xcode_mcp/security.py` (`validate_parent_for_new_project`).

### Selective Test Execution (GET_RUN_DESTINATIONS research)

**Problem**: AppleScript's `test workspaceDoc` command doesn't support filtering specific tests. Need to use `xcodebuild test -only-testing:TestBundle/Class/testMethod`.

**Key Finding**: AppleScript's `active run destination of workspaceDoc` property always returns `missing value` - it's broken/unimplemented.

**Solution**: Use `xcodebuild -showdestinations` to get available destinations:
```bash
xcodebuild -showdestinations -project <path> -scheme <scheme>
# Returns: { platform:iOS Simulator, id:ABC123, OS:17.0, name:iPhone 15 Pro }
```

**Implementation approach**:
1. Query destinations using `xcodebuild -showdestinations`
2. Parse output to extract destination info
3. Select first destination as default (or let user specify)
4. Build xcodebuild command with `-destination` flag

Example code for parsing destinations:
```python
def get_available_destinations(project_path: str, scheme: str):
    is_workspace = project_path.endswith('.xcworkspace')
    flag = '-workspace' if is_workspace else '-project'

    cmd = ['xcodebuild', '-showdestinations', flag, project_path, '-scheme', scheme]
    result = subprocess.run(cmd, capture_output=True, text=True)

    # Parse: { platform:iOS Simulator, id:ABC123, name:iPhone 15 Pro }
    # Return: [{'platform': 'iOS Simulator', 'id': 'ABC123', 'destination_string': 'id=ABC123'}]
```

### Xcode Project Discovery Issues

**Problem**: `get_xcode_projects` uses mdfind (Spotlight) which has indexing delays for newly created/copied projects.

**Current behavior**:
- Tests copy projects to working directory
- mdfind doesn't immediately index these
- Projects aren't found, tests fail

**Solution**: Implement filesystem fallback
```python
def get_xcode_projects_with_fallback(search_path):
    # Try mdfind first (fast for indexed files)
    results = mdfind_projects(search_path)

    if not results and os.path.exists(search_path):
        # Fallback to os.walk for newly created projects
        results = []
        for root, dirs, files in os.walk(search_path):
            for d in dirs:
                if d.endswith(('.xcodeproj', '.xcworkspace')):
                    results.append(os.path.join(root, d))

    return results
```

### Test Infrastructure Notes

**Current test structure**:
```
test_projects/
├── fromXcode/           # Original projects from Xcode (DO NOT MODIFY)
├── templates/           # Modified copies for testing
│   ├── SimpleApp/       # Basic command line app
│   ├── BrokenApp/       # App with compile errors
│   └── ConsoleApp/      # App with console output
└── working/             # Temporary test execution
```

**Known issues**:
1. Build tests fail with "Can't get workspace document" when project not open
2. Xcode shows UI alerts about missing projects during tests
3. Some AppleScript commands require workspace to be loaded first

**Test runner fix that works**:
```python
# Set ALLOWED_FOLDERS in MCP module directly
import drews_xcode_mcp.__main__ as mcp_server
mcp_server.ALLOWED_FOLDERS = {str(self.working_dir)}
```

### Build Error Handling

**Current implementation**: Returns JSON with structured errors/warnings
```json
{
    "full_log_path": "/tmp/xcode-mcp-server/logs/build-{hash}.txt",
    "summary": {"total_errors": N, "total_warnings": M},
    "errors_and_warnings": "error: ...\nwarning: ..."
}
```

**Improvements needed**:
- Better parsing of Swift vs Objective-C errors
- Group errors by file
- Extract fix-it suggestions

### Runtime Output Structure

**Current format**: JSON with intelligent filtering
```json
{
    "full_log_path": "/tmp/xcode-mcp-server/logs/runtime-{hash}.txt",
    "errors": ["error lines with context"],
    "warnings": ["warning lines with context"],
    "matching_lines": ["lines matching regex filter"],
    "summary": {"total_lines": N, "errors": X, "warnings": Y}
}
```

**Note**: Errors and warnings are always included with full context, never lost to filtering.

### Recent Projects Support

**Already implemented** in `get_xcode_projects`:
- Reads from `~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dt.Xcode.plist`
- `IDERecentProjectDocumentURLs` key contains recent projects
- Shown first in results when `include_recents=True`

### Notification System Status

**Decision**: Not implementing typed notification system from NOTIFICATIONS_PLAN.md

**Current state**:
- Simple notification functions in `utils/applescript.py`
- All notifications use "Drew's Xcode MCP" title
- Global `NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED` flag works
- History tracking implemented for debugging

### Important File Paths

**xcresult bundles**:
- Runtime logs: `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/*/Logs/Launch/*.xcresult`
- Test results: `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/*/Logs/Test/*.xcresult`
- Build logs: Captured directly from Xcode UI via AppleScript

**Parsing xcresults**:
```bash
# Get runtime console output
xcrun xcresulttool get --path <xcresult> --id <logRef_id>

# Get test results
xcrun xcresulttool get --path <xcresult> --format json
```

### AppleScript Gotchas

1. **Workspace loading**: Must wait for `loaded of workspaceDoc is true`
2. **String escaping**: Backslashes and quotes must be escaped
3. **Build/test results**: Check `completed of buildResult is true` in loop
4. **Project paths**: Remove trailing slashes, use absolute paths
5. **Timeout handling**: AppleScript operations can hang, need subprocess timeouts

### Security Model

**Current implementation**:
- `ALLOWED_FOLDERS` environment variable or CLI args
- All paths validated: absolute, exist, directory, no '..'
- Default to `$HOME` if not specified
- Every tool validates project path against allowed folders
