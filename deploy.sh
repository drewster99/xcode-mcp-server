# Deployment script for drews-xcode-mcp
# Builds and publishes the package to PyPI, together with a matching release of
# the legacy 'xcode-mcp-server' compatibility shim (see shim/) so existing
# configurations that run the old name keep getting current code.

# If you want to deploy a BETA, this script won't do it,
# but you can do it manually:
#
#   You can use pre-release version numbers following
#     https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/. PyPI will accept them, but pip won't
#     install them by default.
#
#     Pre-release version formats:
#     - 1.2.3b1 - beta 1
#     - 1.2.3a1 - alpha 1
#     - 1.2.3rc1 - release candidate 1
#
#     To publish a beta:
#     python -m hatch version 1.2.3b1  # Set beta version
#     python -m build
#     python -m twine upload dist/*
#
#     Users can install it with:
#     # Specific beta version (safest for testers)
#     pip install drews-xcode-mcp==1.2.3b1
#     uvx drews-xcode-mcp==1.2.3b1
#
#     Regular users doing pip install drews-xcode-mcp will get the latest
#     stable version and skip all pre-releases automatically.
