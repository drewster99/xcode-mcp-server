Changes runtime output from plaintext to structured JSON that includes errors/warnings with unfiltered context, optional regex-matched lines, and a full unfiltered log file for deep analysis.\n\nKey improvements:\n- Errors and warnings never lost to filtering (always included with full context)\n- New matching_lines section shows regex matches up to configurable limit\n- Full unfiltered log written to /tmp/xcode-mcp-server/logs/ for reference\n- Reduces context usage while improving diagnostic quality\n\nðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")"
