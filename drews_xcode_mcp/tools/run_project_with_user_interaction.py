    Run the app and display an alert dialog for you to interact with it.

    The app will run in Xcode/Simulator. Once confirmed running, an alert dialog
    will appear with an "I'm finished - Terminate App" button.

    - Click the button when you're done testing → app will be force-stopped
    - If the app terminates on its own → no force-stop needed

    In either case, runtime logs are extracted and returned after a 2-second wait.

    Perfect for: Interactive testing, manual QA, debugging UI flows

        project_path: Path to an Xcode project/workspace directory

        max_lines: Maximum number of matching lines to return (default 20)
